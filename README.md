# HvH Reduxv2
Garry's Mod Hack VS Hack Gamemode

This is a full remake of the original Hack VS Hack Redux gamemode by noPE
It is a fairly simple free for all non round based deathmatch gamemode

## Features

- A clean & simple gradient HUD & scoreboard
- Changable loadouts, player models, & settings via F1/F2/F3/F4
- Configurable killstreaks with optional/configurable quakesounds

## Installation

Slap the gamemode into your server's gamemodes folder

Configure **hvh2/gamemode/config.lua** to your liking, there are notes explaining everything

Set these variables in your server.cfg **sv_maxupdaterate 128** and  **sv_maxcmdrate 128**

**Optional:** replace the shitty weapon pack with something better, I never got around to doing it.

## Content

The content pack is currently just the quakesounds, the clients will automatically be subscribed to it.
